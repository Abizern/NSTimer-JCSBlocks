h1. NSTimer+JCSBlocks

An extension of NSTimer that lets you use a block to be run when the timer fires instead of passing a callback method.

There are two methods; one which lets you fires an optionally repeating timer with a block, and another which lets you fire a timer repeatedly, but which can be stopped from within the passed block.

h2. Branch structure for submodules

There are two branches to this repository, *master* and *demo*. If you just want to use the class extension, the *master* branch is the one you should be using.

h3. The master Branch

The *master* branch just contains the class files and this README file. This is the branch to use if you are installing the class files as a Git submodule. As submodules are added in a headless state it is often preferable to explicitly state the branch you are cloning. So this is the command I recommend you use:

bc. git submodule add -b master https://github.com/Abizern/NSTimer-JCSBlocks

h3. The demo Branch

the *demo* branch contains a very simple example of the use of this class extension. No development of the main files should be done on that branch.

Changes made to the master branch will be merged across to demo, so it should always remain current with respect to master.

h3. Updates

To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual

bc. git pull origin

h3. Artefacts

Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to production. These are files that are ignored by Git and are easily cleaned up by running

bc. git clean -dxf
