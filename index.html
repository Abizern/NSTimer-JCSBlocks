    <h1><a href="https://github.com/Abizern/NSTimer-JCSBlocks">NSTimer+JCSBlocks</a></h1>

    <div class="description">
      An extension to NSTimer that allows you to pass a block to handle timer events instead of using a callback method.
    </div>

    
      <p>There are two methods; one which lets you fires an optionally repeating timer with a block, and another which lets you fire a timer repeatedly, but which can be stopped from within the passed block.</p>
    

      <h2>Dependencies</h2>
			<p>There is no memory management code in this extension, so it will work on Mac OS and iOS with ARC and Mac OS with GC.</p>
			
      <p>This code uses a macro, ZAssert, which requires that you make additions to your Projectâ€™s PCH file. You can get these macros from <a href="http://gist.github.com/325926">http://gist.github.com/325926</a>  which also contains links to show you how they are used.</p>
      
      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>Documentation is generated from the code by <a href="http://www.gentlebytes.com/home/appledocapp/">appledoc</a> and is available <a href="http://abizern.github.com/NSTimer-JCSBlocks/docs/index.html">online here</a>.
      
      <h2>Branch structure for submodules</h2>
      
      <p>There are two branches to this repository, <strong>master</strong> and <strong>demo</strong>. If you just want to use the class extension, the <strong>master</strong> branch is the one you should be using.</p>
      
      
      	<h3>The master Branch</h3>
      
      
      	<p>The <strong>master</strong> branch just contains the class files and this <span class="caps">README</span> file. This is the branch to use if you are installing the class files as a Git submodule. As submodules are added in a headless state it is often preferable to explicitly state the branch you are cloning. So this is the command I recommend you use:</p>
      
      
      	<pre><code>git submodule add -b master https://github.com/Abizern/NSTimer-JCSBlocks</code></pre>
      
      
      	<h3>The demo Branch</h3>
      
      
      	<p>the <strong>demo</strong> branch contains a very simple example of the use of this class extension. No development of the main files should be done on that branch.</p>
      
      
      	<p>Changes made to the master branch will be merged across to demo, so it should always remain current with respect to master.</p>
      
      
      	<h2>Updates</h2>
      
      
      	<p>To keep up to date with the latest changes `cd` into the directory that contains this submodule and pull the newest changes as usual</p>
      
      
      	<pre><code>git pull origin</code></pre>
      
      
      	<h2>Artefacts</h2>
      
      
      	<p>Sometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to production. These are files that are ignored by Git and are easily cleaned up by running</p>
      
      
      	<pre><code>git clean -dxf</code></pre>
